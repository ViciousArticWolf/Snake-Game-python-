🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A simple yet fun implementation of the classic Snake Game, built using Python’s Turtle Graphics module.
The project demonstrates core concepts of event-driven programming, real-time input handling, and collision detection in a 2D graphical environment.

🎯 Features

Real-time snake movement using arrow keys.

Food generation at random positions.

Dynamic snake growth on food consumption.

Collision detection with walls and self.

Automatic game reset after collisions.

Smooth gameplay loop with adjustable speed.

🧠 Concepts Used

Event-Driven Programming: Keyboard bindings for movement.

Game Loop: Continuous screen updates with frame delays.

Collision Detection: Boundary checks and segment distance checks.

List Manipulation: Dynamic management of snake segments.

Randomization: Random placement of food using the random module.
